This Basic Calculator is a simple Java console application that allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. It features a user-friendly menu and utilizes Java methods and conditionals to handle calculations efficiently.

Features:
✔ User-friendly menu – Allows users to select an operation from the following:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)
✔ Exception handling – Prevents division by zero errors.
✔ Looping functionality – Users can perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
✔ Method-based operations – Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate method for modularity.

How It Works:
The program displays a menu and prompts the user to choose an arithmetic operation.

The user enters two numbers for the calculation.

The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.

If division by zero is attempted, an error message is shown instead of crashing the program.

The user can continue performing calculations or exit the application.
